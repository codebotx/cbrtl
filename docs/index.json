[{"content":"What is cbrtl? cbrtl is an attempt at creating a tight knit group of programmers to showcase and collaborate on projects and\nWhat do we do here? Create fun projects. Either in groups or in isolation. Organize community and online showcases for group and individual projects. Contribute to Open Source projects both in cbrtl and in other communities. Conduct code reviews and JAMs. Share resources to learn. Create and maintain dev-journals and blogs. What is the end goal? Merely to promote Open Source culture and proper software development within our college.\nHow far down the road are we? Not that far, the egg has just been laid. As of the time of writing this post, we have just started out. For the effort to work out, we welcome interested folks over :)\nWhat can I do? Just what you\u0026rsquo;ve been doing so far, but with more people!\nIf you have any interesting projects that you have already been working on, let us know and we\u0026rsquo;ll put them on the cbrtl page for more people to see. Note that there is some criteria that projects must qualify, some of these are intentionally vague. But as long as you\u0026rsquo;re doing more than following a course or tutorial, it\u0026rsquo;s likely to be accepted :)\nVolunteering to cbrtl We are looking for volunteers for some roles. Note however, that there is no strict mandate for responsibilities. As long as you\u0026rsquo;re capable of adding something of value, no matter how small, shoot us a message! We\u0026rsquo;re looking for some help with:\nCode reviewers: If you have experience contributing to FOSS or writing code for user/developer facing products, perhaps you can volunteer and help us out here :)\nEditors: We plan on writing frequent blog posts. But both the technical content and the english material can use a second pair of eyes to help catch mistakes or inconsistent writing. If you have done some technical writing before, you can volunteer for reviewing the content in blog posts!\nTechnical Writers: If you have experience writing code but are usually on a tight schedule, you may be able to join us and share your knowledge. We want to mandate a high quality in our posts, so any tutorial/how-to guide that has been done a million times before is generally discouraged. We want to avoid redundant topics like \u0026ldquo;How to build a todo app with React\u0026rdquo; and promote posts and dev-logs / journals that are fun to read and explore.\nFrontend devs: Currently, the cbrtl website is bland and not-so-catchy. While minimalism is the core idea, we can definitely use some front-end developers to help keep the UI fresh, responsive and modern.\nModerators: To help keep the community together on discord and github.\nNOTE We do not expect any amount of time commitment from volunteers, as long as you can make small contributions, we appreciate it. Volunteering is not druge work, and active frequent contributions are appreciated, but not required.\nThe kind of software we want to write We firmly believe in re-inventing the wheel. Writing software close to the metal helps us closely understand the behind-the-scenes of software that most take for granted. While any creative project is welcome, here are some ideas that adhere to the spirit:\nCompilers Virtual Machines and Interpreters Game Engines Operating Systems Search Engines Database engines Voxel renderers TCP/IP stack VCS All of these are but regular software that we tend to take for granted, that can be (and have been) written from scratch. We encourage all kinds of creative projects no matter how basic. But you can expect the above group projects to come to life as the community grows.\nShowcasing your project This post has more on that. If you want to showcase your project on our github org, then reach out to us on discord or the mailing list.\n","permalink":"https://anubhavp.dev/cbrtl/posts/what-and-why/","summary":"What is cbrtl? cbrtl is an attempt at creating a tight knit group of programmers to showcase and collaborate on projects and\nWhat do we do here?

It\u0026rsquo;s named \u0026ldquo;Vyse\u0026rdquo;, after Guinsoo\u0026rsquo;s Scythe of Vyse from DotA.\nVyse is a dynamically typed, interpreted and fast scriptling language inspired by Lua for rapid prototyping of applications like video games. Programmers familiar with Lua/Javascript can pick up the language within an hour. Vyse also comes with a C++ API for frictionless embedding in projects.\nFeatures include:\nModules, both native and user-level An embedding API Closures, higher order functions to facilitate FP. Prototypical inheritance, inspired from JS and Lua. Since the language already has detailed (but remarkably outdated) documentation on its website, I won\u0026rsquo;t bother rewriting any of that here.\nInstead, here is the simple number-guessing program:\nconst math = import(\u0026#34;math\u0026#34;) fn play() { const num = math.randint(0, 100) let guess = input(\u0026#34;guess: \u0026#34;):to_num() let n_attempts = 1 while guess != num { if guess \u0026lt; num { print(\u0026#34;Too low! Try higher.\u0026#34;) } else { print(\u0026#34;Too high! Try lower.\u0026#34;) } n_attempts += 1 guess = input(\u0026#34;guess: \u0026#34;):to_num() } print(\u0026#34;Well done! number of attempts: \u0026#34;, n_attempts) } play() Of course, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to do more than just write simple terminal programs. For instance, I\u0026rsquo;m currently working on a 2D game engine that will allow users to write games with the language. This project hasn\u0026rsquo;t seen any major progress in the past year owing to my busy (read: poorly managed) schedule, however, I\u0026rsquo;m looking to resume this project in the coming quarter.\nCurrently, there are no official releases for Vyse. This is majorly due to me not being in possession of a windows (yuck) device ATM. There are some bugs that I\u0026rsquo;ve yet to prune out before I can make a stable v0.1 release for all platforms.\nThe one benefit of having no users, is a leisurely development pace.\n","permalink":"https://anubhavp.dev/cbrtl/posts/vyse/","summary":"Sometime during my 2nd year in college, I\u0026rsquo;d made a hobby programming language that turned out quite well.

Some of my acquaintances from other colleges have clubs, groups and spaces dedicated to open source and software development. Couple of days ago, I came across IIT Roorkee\u0026rsquo;s SDSLabs and PES Uni\u0026rsquo;s PES Open Source. After looking into it a bit more, turns out most colleges these days have their own groups for related stuff.\nWe thought it would be fun to have a similar group of like minded developers from our college.\nIs it too ambitious? We won\u0026rsquo;t know until we don\u0026rsquo;t try.\nWhat is it that cbrtl aims to do exactly? Good question. We don\u0026rsquo;t have a concrete answer. That said, I\u0026rsquo;ll throw in most of what we\u0026rsquo;ve gathered from our goal so far, and you decide if you like the sound of it.\nContributing to Open Source. Talks and meetups. Showcasing projects from individuals and teams. Code reviews and educational blogs (hopefully ones that haven\u0026rsquo;t been done to death before\u0026hellip;). What platforms are you present on? For now, our presence is limited to Discord and the GitHub organization. Mostly because these are very solid platforms and we are tight on the number of people moderating.\nWhat skills do I need? Not much.\nThe ability to code. The willingness to learn. Basic knowledge of Git and GitHub. Even 1 and 3 are optional.\nWhere do I join? As mentioned earlier, you can join the Discord and the GitHub organization. More info on Getting started with cbrtl and Open Source.\nIs there anything I can do to help? You can volunteer to help us keep the community thriving. We are looking for volunteers who can help with:\nFront end development: To touch up the current blog site. Moderation: To manage the discord server and the GitHub org. Code reviews: To mandate some code quality for those who demand it. Technical Writers: To aid in writing blog posts. Editors: A second pair of eyes helps catch common mistakes in writing :) Is this an official college club? No. This is an entirely independent student initiative that is looking for active participation. A decentralized group of like-minded programmers.\nWill there be events with cash prizes? No. And we want to be upfront about it. We want to keep this community closed to people who code because they like creating. Of course, that is not to say we discredit any other motivation you may have.\nAs such, we won\u0026rsquo;t conduct any competitions with cash prizes for the foreseeable future. Other clubs (which are official) in our college do a great (citation needed*) job at that regardless.\nWhat kinds of events can I expect? Other than project showcases and on-demand code review sessions, we are open to other ideas.\nNot as much of an \u0026rsquo;event\u0026rsquo; but you can expect group projects that will (hopefully) be active throughout.\nI have some other questions, where can I ask?

Anything that serves a clear purpose. A project can be showcased if it satisfies the following criteria:\nHas a proper github README.md Is not a tutorial follow-through. So anything along these lines is generally discouraged: \u0026ldquo;todo app in react\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;planner app in vue\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;terminal tic-tac-toe with C\u0026rdquo; and so on\u0026hellip; Is being actively worked on by it\u0026rsquo;s developer(s).

A blog post referencing the content from your write-up, describing the project. Encourage other members to collaborate and contribute. A good place to start getting involved can be our Discord server.\nHave an idea? Want a team? It is not so uncommon for programmers to get an idea but not have enough time commitment (or knowledge) to drive the idea to fruition. If that\u0026rsquo;s how things end up for you, then we might be able to help with pointing you in the right direction.\nWe may be able to help turn your solo idea into a collaborative work environment.

It can mean different things for different people, but the recurring ideas are the same.\nWays to participate Contributing to the blog. Part-taking in open source projects being built in the community. Coming up with your own project ideas, and getting people to contribute. Showcasing projects you have made on cbrtl blog and GitHub organization. Contributing to larger open source projects outside cbrtl. Asking questions, getting to know people better.
