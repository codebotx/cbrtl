Rust was created to ensure high performance similar to that offered by C and C++,  but with emphasis on code safety, the lack of which is the Achilles heel of these two languages. However, Rust has more than just memory safety on its side. High performance while processing large amounts of data, support for concurrent programming, and this together with an effective compiler are other reasons why well-known software heavyweights now use this programming language. Firefox, Dropbox, Cloudflare, and many other companies from startups to large corporations use Rust in production.
